# Self Host White Labeling

## Overview

For a nominal annual fee, you are able to white label the client facing pages of the application. This removes all client faces pages (and PDFs) of any Invoice Ninja branding.

The admin interface and the admin notificaiton emails will still retain the Invoice Ninja branding.

## How to enable

You can use the link on the navigation menu to purchase a white label license. 

There's an option to manually apply the license on Settings > Account Management.

Note: to support e-invoicing add `LICENSE_KEY="your_white_label_license"` to the [.env file](/docs/self-host/env-variables).
