For example, you can select enter April 4th in the date field by typing 404 and 1.5 in a time field will be converted to one and a half hours.The app version (ie. v5.1.56-A47) is comprised of two parts: the API version and the Admin Portal version.

It's usually calculated as a percentage and added to the price of a product or service at the point of sale. Unlike some countries where a value-added tax (VAT) is utilized, in the U.S., there is no national sales tax. Instead, sales tax is levied at the state, county, and sometimes even at the municipal level, making it somewhat complex.This means that the sales tax can vary significantly from one location to another, not just from state to state, but even within a state. For example, in one city, the total sales tax might be 6%, while in another, it might be 9%. Some states, like Oregon and Delaware, don't impose any sales tax at all.Products and services can also be taxed differently. For instance, some states tax groceries, while others don't. Similarly, some states offer tax holidays, specific times during the year when sales tax is not charged on certain items.To accurately calculate sales tax, it's important to know:\nThe precise location of the sale (the \"nexus\").\nThe type of product or service being sold.\nThe current tax rate in that location.\nInvoice Ninja can simplify this process for you by automating the sales tax calculation. It identifies the appropriate tax rate based on the 'ship-to' address on the invoice, and applies it to the taxable items in your invoice. It stays updated with the current tax rates across different locations, ensuring that your invoices are always compliant with the most recent tax laws.\nRemember, managing sales tax correctly is not only good for your business operations, but it's also a legal obligation. Having the ability to automatically calculate sales tax will save you time, reduce errors, and ensure that you're collecting the correct amount of tax on each sale, which is crucial for your business's tax reporting and remittance."},{"id":197,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#configure-us-tax-calculations","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Configure US tax calculations","body":"If you are a hosted Invoice Ninja client with a Pro or Enterprise plan, you can turn on tax calculations with these steps:"},{"id":198,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#turn-on-calculate-taxes","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Turn on Calculate Taxes","body":"Settings > Tax SettingsYour company's country in Invoice Ninja must be set to either United States, Australia, or an EU country for the Calculate Taxes option to appear.

Some states tax all services, some tax only certain services, while others don't tax services at all. For instance, repair and maintenance services might be taxed in one state, but not in another. Similarly, professional services such as legal or consulting services may be exempt in some states, but taxable in others.To handle the range of tax possibilities you can assign tax categories to your products.The available tax categories are as follows:\nPhysical Goods\nDigital Products\nServices\nShipping\nTax Exempt\nReduced Tax\nOverride Tax\nZero Rated\nReverse Tax (Use Tax)\n"},{"id":200,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#physical-goods","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Physical Goods","body":"Sales tax on physical goods, also known as tangible personal property, is one of the most common forms of sales tax in the United States.

While it might seem similar to tax-exempt items, there is a crucial difference. When an item is zero-rated, it technically remains taxable, but at a rate of 0%. The key advantage here is that while the end consumer doesn't pay any tax on these goods or services, the businesses involved in the supply chain may still reclaim input taxes (if applicable), something that is not allowed for tax-exempt items.However, it's important to note that the concept of zero-rated goods is more commonly associated with countries that use a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, such as those in the European Union or Canada. In these systems, certain essential goods like food or books are often zero-rated to reduce the cost burden on consumers, while still allowing businesses to claim back VAT they've paid on inputs.In the United States, which uses a sales tax system rather than VAT, the concept of zero-rating doesn't apply in the same way. Instead, states usually categorize goods and services as either taxable, exempt, or taxable at a reduced rate."},{"id":207,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#reverse-tax-(use-tax)","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Reverse Tax (Use Tax)","body":"The concept of \"reverse tax\" is often used in the context of \"use tax\". In the United States, a use tax is typically a type of tax charged to consumers who purchase goods or services from outside their home state for use in their home state, and where no sales tax has been charged.Essentially, use tax is the counterpart to sales tax and is designed to discourage consumers from buying out-of-state in order to avoid sales tax. It also helps to level the playing field between in-state retailers (who have to charge sales tax) and out-of-state retailers (who often don't).The rate of use tax is generally the same as the sales tax that would have been charged if the purchase had been made in-state. Therefore, if you buy an item tax-free from an online retailer located in another state, but you use the item in your home state, you're usually responsible for paying use tax to your state.Keep in mind, it's typically the buyer's responsibility to calculate, report, and remit use tax to the appropriate tax authority. This can get complicated for businesses making numerous out-of-state purchases. However, some states require larger businesses or those with a significant presence (nexus) in the state to charge use tax at the point of sale, effectively reversing the normal taxation process, hence the term \"reverse tax\"."},{"id":208,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#tax-exemptions","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Tax Exemptions","body":"In the realm of sales tax, tax exemptions are specific scenarios where sales tax does not have to be paid on certain goods, services, or transactions. These exemptions are set by the tax authority, often at the state level in the United States, and can vary greatly from one state to another.Product-based Exemptions: Certain types of goods may be exempt from sales tax. For example, necessities like groceries and prescription medications are often tax-exempt. Clothing is also exempt in some states, and many states offer temporary exemptions for back-to-school supplies during certain periods of the year.Use-based Exemptions: This refers to situations where an item is used in a way that qualifies it to be tax-exempt. For instance, goods that are purchased for resale are often exempt from sales tax, as the tax will ultimately be paid by the end consumer. Similarly, items used in manufacturing or items purchased by non-profit organizations are often tax-exempt.Buyer-based Exemptions: In some cases, the buyer's status can lead to a tax exemption. For instance, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and certain other groups may not have to pay sales tax on their purchases.Transaction-based Exemptions: Certain types of sales transactions may be exempt from sales tax. For example, sales involving interstate commerce may be exempt in some cases.If you sell goods and services to a client who is tax exempt, you can mark them as tax exempt by editing their client record and setting the tax exempt switch on."},{"id":209,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#configure-eu-tax-calculations","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Configure EU tax calculations","body":""},{"id":210,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#settings.","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Settings.","body":"The calculation engine for the EU has recently been updated to support EU wide tax calculations!

Choose one, and any fees or limits you set will be associated specifically with that payment method only.\nMin Limit & Max Limit - Enter a dollar value for the desired minimum, or maximum payment limits, and check the \"Enable Min\" or \"Enable Max\" boxes to enforce the minimum and maximum values.\nFee Percent - Set a fee on transactions with this payment method, based on a % of the amount paid.\nFee Amount - Set a flat rate fee for any transactions with this payment method. Can be charged in addition to the Fee Percent, if both values are set.\nFee Cap - Set a maximum value for payment method fees charged to a client.\nTax - When one, two, or three Item Tax Rates are enabled (Basic Settings > Tax Settings) you will see one Tax field here for each tax rate. These taxes are applied to the payment gateway fees you charge the customer.\nAdjust Fee Percent - Use the toggle switch to enable this feature. Use this when you intent to forward along the payment gateway fees to the customer. For example, if the payment processing fee for your Stripe account is 30 cents flat, and 1%, and you wanted to pass that to the customer, you would enter a 0.30 flat Fee Amount, and 1 for Fee Percent, and enable the Adjust Fee Percent. Because the total with fees will be higher, the actual fees Stripe charges will be higher also. With this feature, Invoice Ninja will calculate and adjust the fee to charge the customer the expected fee amount, after the final invoice price is changed.\n\nNote - When attempting to perfectly capture the payment gateway fee 100% and apply it to the client's payment using Adjust Fee Percent, you must disable Invoice Tax Rates and exclusively use Item Tax Rates (Basic Settings > Tax Settings). When a payment fee is applied to a customer invoice, it is entered as a line item, and any invoice tax rates will be applied to the fee, which will throw off the formula to calculate the new fee percent correctly.\nYou are responsible for verifying that your tax and fee settings comply with any laws that apply. Seek legal counsel if you require direction on fee and tax policies for your organization.\n\n"},{"id":228,"uri":"\/en\/gateways\/#notes","title":"Payment Gateways","sub_title":"Notes","body":"We no longer support the PayPal Express API integration, we've updated to the \"PayPal Platform\" and now also support Venmo via PayPal."},{"id":229,"uri":"\/en\/gateways\/#stripe","title":"Payment Gateways","sub_title":"Stripe","body":"\n    \nOur Stripe integration includes a wide range of payment options including:\nCard\nACH\nSOFORT\nAlipay\nPay\nSEPA\nBancontact\niDEAL\nGiropay\nPrzelewy24\nEPS\nACSS\nBECS\nFPX\nBTCPay\nOur Stripe integration also includes token billing and refunds"},{"id":230,"uri":"\/en\/gateways\/#square","title":"Payment Gateways","sub_title":"Square","body":"Our Square integration includes Credit Card payment options, including token billing, and refunds.

To start, simply create a new template inSettings \/ Invoice Design \/ Custom DesignsYou will see that along with providing a name for the design\/template, there is a new selector which allows you to choose whether the design is a regular design (ie for invoices \/ quotes) or a template which can also be a custom design, but also includes the power twig syntax and data to create bespoke templates.After selecting the template option, a series of checkboxes will appear where you can associate the data types with the template. This is an important step as it allows us to provide the menu options for this template in the correct location and also provides the correct context when running the template;for example, if you select the invoice checkbox, the system will be able to prepare your invoice\/s to be run through the template. You can select multiple options here and the system will ensure this data is prepared and ready for use in the template.How did we construct this? Lets take a look at a template sample:Embedded in the html\/css is a dedicated set of <ninja><\/ninja> tags, this tells the template engine that we are now using the Twig Templating system.Templates always assume that the data being processed in an array of objects. In this particular case, we have an array of projects. If your template will only ever consider a single project then you'll want to harvest the first project in your array of projects using this syntax:{% if projects %}\n{% set project = projects|first %}Now that we have the project object, we can use this in our template, to print a variable to the template, you would wrap the variable in {{ }} like this:<h1>{{ project.name }}<\/h1>\n<h3>Due: {{ project.due_date }}<\/h3>\n<h6>{{ project.current_hours }} \/ {{ project.budgeted_hours }}: (Hours \/ Budgeted Hours @ {{ project.task_rate }}) - Report generated on {{ \"now\"|date('Y-m-d') }}<\/h6>We've now started to introduce variables into our template and also some nifty twig formats for dynamic data such as a date using this following syntax to present when the report was generatedReport generated on {{ \"now\"|date('Y-m-d') }}Lets now loop through the project tasks and output the time_log data with the following sequence{% for task in project.tasks %}\n\n    {% for log in task.time_log %}\n\n    <tr>\n        <td>{{ log.start_date }}<\/td>\n        <td>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>{{ log.description }}<\/li>\n                    <li>{{ task.user.name }}<\/li>\n                <\/ul>\n            <\/div>\n\n        <\/td>\n        <td>{{ log.duration|date('h:i:s')}}<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    {% endfor %}\n\n{% endfor %}Here we have created a for loop, iterating over every task in the project, this follows with another for loop where we loop over every time_log entry in each task where we output the dates \/ description and duration of each task.Finally, we are able to transform the log.duration (seconds), into a date format with h:i:s format (Hours:Minutes:Seconds)"},{"id":615,"uri":"\/en\/templates\/#using-blocks-in-templates","title":"Templates","sub_title":"Using blocks in templates","body":"If you wish to use standard company\/client\/vendor details, this is super simple using standard div blocks:<div id=\"client-details\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"company-details\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"company-address\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"vendor-details\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"shipping-address\"><\/div>These will populate using the data stored in Settings > Invoice Designs for each block."},{"id":616,"uri":"\/en\/templates\/#data-access","title":"Templates","sub_title":"Data Access","body":""},{"id":617,"uri":"\/en\/templates\/#twig-variables","title":"Templates","sub_title":"Twig variables","body":"Accessing data using twig would be as follows:First we'd check to ensure the variable is available{% if tasks|e %}\n{% endif %}Then we can iterate{% if tasks|e %}\n\n    {% for task in tasks %}\n    {% endfor %}\n\n{% endif %}Accessing data is done using dot notation, for example retrieving the client name of a tasks project would be as follows:{{ task.project.client.name }}"},{"id":618,"uri":"\/en\/templates\/#invoice-ninja-variables","title":"Templates","sub_title":"Invoice Ninja variables","body":"Standard $ notation variables are also available within templates, this allows you to use familiar variables such as $invoice.amount - you can also combine twig and ninja variables like this to integrate conditionals into your template. ie\n{% if invoice.balance > 0 %}\n $invoice.balance is payable!\n{% else %}\n Invoice has been paid!

One of the values that can be set in this file is \"APP_DEBUG\". This value controls whether or not detailed error messages are displayed when an error occurs in the application.When \"APP_DEBUG\" is set to \"true\", Laravel will display detailed error messages that can include sensitive information such as the file path, database credentials, and other configuration details. This information can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application and its underlying infrastructure.Leaving \"APP_DEBUG\" set to \"true\" in a production environment is a security concern because it can allow attackers to gain valuable information about the application and its environment. Attackers can use this information to craft targeted attacks against the application or its users, and can also use it to gain unauthorized access to the underlying infrastructure.To mitigate this security concern, it is recommended to set \"APP_DEBUG\" to \"false\" in the \".env\" file of a production environment. This will prevent detailed error messages from being displayed and help to protect the application and its users from potential attacks. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all sensitive information is properly secured and not exposed in error messages or other application outputs.The following CVEs have been reported exploiting this:\nCVE-2020-15168: Laravel 7.x before 7.27.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an \"Unrestricted File Upload\" vulnerability via a request to \"\/debugbar\/file\".\nCVE-2019-16785: Laravel Framework through 5.8.35 allows unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site that is mishandled by the \"artisan serve\" command.\nCVE-2018-15133: In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value, because of the fallback mechanism for CSRF tokens.\nThese vulnerabilities demonstrate the potential for serious security issues when APP_DEBUG=true is left enabled in a production environment. It is therefore crucial to take appropriate security measures to protect against these types of attacks."},{"id":677,"uri":"\/en\/advanced-settings\/#invoice-design","title":"Advanced Settings","sub_title":"Invoice Design","body":"These settings govern customization of the standard document design and layout used by default on new invoices, quotes, and credits.

Custom toggle switch for active membership\/license status, employee opt-in for night shifts, or check box value for products in inventory.\n\n\nDropdown - This generates a field with a dropdown menu to select from a list, and you will be immediately asked to present a comma separated list of values to populate the drop down menu with.  \n\n\nDate - A date field requests a date value, and on the admin UI, will even present a widget for date selection to help formatting the field value.

If you do not configure the cron scheduler, the migration will not work and you will end up with a blank company with no content. \n    Please note v5.3.0 now requires PHP 7.4.
