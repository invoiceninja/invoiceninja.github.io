# Introduction

## App Basics

<p>The app interface is divided into three parts: the sidebar navigation menu, the list (or table) and the preview. The layout can be customized to fit your needs using a combination of the icons at the bottom of the screen and the option on Settings > Device Settings.</p>

<p>By default all supported modules are enabled, if you know you won't be using some of the features you can disable them on Settings > Account Management > Enabled Modules.</p>

<p>In many cases in the app a single tap will take one action, while a long tap will provide a shortcut to a common secondary action. For example tapping on the 'Clients' option in the sidebar will load the clients view, whereas long tapping it will instead create a new client. This pattern is used throughout the app.</p>

## Debugging Problems

<p>If you run into any problems you can contact us directly in the app using the support icon in the bottom left corner of the screen. If you're using the web app you can add `?clear=true` to the URL to clear the browser's local cache. If you're using the mobile app it may help to uninstall the app and then re-install the app.</p>
