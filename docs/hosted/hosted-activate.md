## Activate v5 / Deactivate v4

You've migrated your data. You've checked everything in v5 and it all looks great, awesome!

Now you'll want to turn "on" your v5 account and turn "off" your v4 account. What does this mean?

When you turn "off" v4 you will no longer generate reminders or recurring invoices on your v4 account. And any existing links your clients use will be forwarded across to your new v5 installation.

To deactivate v4, log into your v4 account and navigate to Settings > Account Management and navigate down to the tab which says 'Forward customers to v5'.
