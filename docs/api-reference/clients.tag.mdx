or business entity that you provide services or products to.

### Key Features

- Handle multiple contacts per client
- Track client-specific settings and preferences

### Client Statuses
- Active: Client is currently active and can be billed
- Archived: Client is archived and hidden from active lists
- Deleted: Client is marked for deletion but retained in the database

### Best Practices
- Always validate client email addresses
- Use unique client numbers for easy reference
- Keep contact information up to date
- Set appropriate client-specific currency and tax settings
