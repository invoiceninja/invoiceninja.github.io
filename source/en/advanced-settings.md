# Advanced Settings

<h2 id=invoice_design>Invoice Design</h2>

These settings govern customization of the standard document design and layout used by default on new invoices, quotes, and credits.  

### General Settings

#### Customize & Preview

This button takes you to a very advanced template code editor, with a live preview generator.  Instructions for these features can be found under <a href="https://invoiceninja.github.io/en/custom-fields/">under PDF Customizations</a>.  You can preview the invoice design templates here, before selecting one you like to use permanently.

#### Template Settings

* **Quote Design** - Select a default design template for quotes.

* **Credit Design** - Select a default design template for credits.

* **Page Layout** - Choose to setup your documents in portrait, or landscape mode.

* **Reset** - The button at the bottom resets the itemized list to its default values.

The following is a list of the sections included in various documents, invoices, quotes, credits, and each item in the list has its own tab in the Invoice Design settings menu, to customize the values that will be presented on your generated documents.

* **Client Details** - Fields added and removed here affect the section of your documents that print client record values.

* **Company Details** - Fields added and removed here affect the section of your documents that print company record values.

* **Company Address** - The company address is often presented in another location on the page, so it is separated into it's own section here as well.

* **Invoice Details** - These fields populate values from the invoice record itself, to create the section that describes what invoice this is.

* **Quote Details** - These fields populate values from the quote record itself, to create the section that describes what quote this is.

* **Credit Details** - These fields populate values from the credit record itself, to create the section that describes what credit this is.

<h2 id=custom_fields>Custom Fields</h2>

<div class="video_container">
<x-video src="/assets/videos/advanced/custom_fields/custom_fields.mpd" is_dash="true" id="custom-fields-video"></x-video>
</div>

Custom Fields options control up to 4 custom fields to include in all entity records, to describe the entities with that can be shown in your PDF and documented transactions, or kept for admin records only.  You can use these to add details about a liquor license to your own company, details about memberships to clients, or certifications of your employees assigned to tasks, or other details.

There are 5 different options for field types regardless of the type of record the custom field applies to.  In each case, you will select a field type on the right, and the value you enter on the left will represent the name of that custom field in forms and in the admin UI.

To include a custom field, just give the field a name.  Without a field name, it will not appear in your entity records.  To remove a custom field, just delete the field name completely.

* **Single-line Text** - Simply accepts a single line of arbitrary text for an entry.

* **Multi-line Text** - Accepts multiple lines of arbitrary text, more suitable for more detailed notes.

* **Switch** - This field is suited for true/false statements or yes/no states.  Custom toggle switch for active membership/license status, employee opt-in for night shifts, or check box value for products in inventory.

* **Dropdown** - This generates a field with a dropdown menu to select from a list, and you will be immediately asked to present a comma separated list of values to populate the drop down menu with.  

* **Date** - A date field requests a date value, and on the admin UI, will even present a widget for date selection to help formatting the field value.  Good for license/certificate expiry dates, product manufacture date, etc.

Each of these 5 field types can be assigned to up to 4 custom fields per entity type, selectable from the tabs at the top of the Custom Fields settings page.

* **Company** - These custom fields apply to the company record, as in the one for your company specifically.

* **Clients** - These custom fields apply to a client record, or the individual contact records nested in a client record.

* **Products** - These fields apply to each product record, to better describe the items in your inventory.

* **Invoices** - In addition to having 4 custom field options for your invoice records, you can also add a surcharge field.  The name of the field is entered here, and you select whether or not to apply tax.  The same tax applied to the entire invoice, otherwise it is exempt from it.  From the admin portal you will see the new surcharge field listed on every invoice above the tax drop downs, and it will expect you to assign an arbitrary dollar value to charge the client. 

*  **Payments** - Custom fields that appear in payment records.

* **Vendors** - Custom fields to help further describe your company's vendors, like your credit terms with them.

* **Expenses** - Add more detail to your expense records with custom fields for a tax category of your expenses to help at the end of the year.

* **Users** - These custom fields add detail to your user account records for registered users of the admin portal.  This would be a good place to put employee details if you plan to use the tasks system or have many users to manage.

<h2 id=generated_numbers>Generated Numbers</h2>

Generated numbers contain a collection of variables that allow very fine grained customization of generated numbers for any entity in the application.

### Available Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|----------|
| $counter | The current count of the entity |
| $client_counter | The current count of the client entity |
| $group_counter | The current count of the group entity |
| $date:Y-m-d | The current date in the defined format ie Y-m-d |
| $year | The current year |
| $user_id | The user id of the creator of the entity |
| $client_custom1 | The value of the first custom field of the client entity |
| $client_custom2 | The value of the second custom field of the client entity |
| $client_custom3 | The value of the third custom field of the client entity |
| $client_custom4 | The value of the fourth custom field of the client entity |
| $client_id_number | The Client ID number |
| $client_number | The Client number |
| $vendor_custom1 | The value of the first custom field of the vendor entity |
| $vendor_custom2 | The value of the second custom field of the vendor entity |
| $vendor_custom3 | The value of the third custom field of the vendor entity |
| $vendor_custom4 | The value of the fourth custom field of the vendor entity |
| $vendor_id_number | The Vendor ID number |
| $vendor_number | The Vendor number |
| $expense_id_number | The matching Client or Vendor ID number |
| $user_custom1 | The value of the first custom field of the user entity |
| $user_custom2 | The value of the second custom field of the user entity |
| $user_custom3 | The value of the third custom field of the user entity |
| $user_custom4 | The value of the fourth custom field of the user entity |

To use these variables in your number patterns, you can add them like this:

```bash
{$date:y}-{$counter}-{$user_custom1}
```

<x-warning>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The patterns must resolve to a UNIQUE number, duplicates are not allowed and the generated number will not be applied - or - will be modified to be unique.
    </p>
</x-warning>


### Settings

![alt text](/assets/images/settings/generated_numbers/generated_numbers_settings_pane.png "Generated Numbers Settings")

The settings tab contains the most general options that apply to number generation.  The other tabs provide more specific options that apply exclusively to each entity type.  The rules here apply broadly to every entity type.

* **Number Padding** - The number padding drop down indicates how many leading zeros you'd like before each number. The default padding is 3 leading zeros ie 0001,0002,0003.

* **Generate Number** - The generate number option allows you to customize WHEN the number is applied, there are two configurations; When Saved (will apply immediate when you save an entity) or When Sent (when the entity is sent / marked as sent).

* **Recurring Prefix** - The recurring prefix is a prefix which is applied to entities that are created when a recurring entity has been generated.

* **Shared Invoice/Quote Counter** - The shared invoice quote counter switch enables sharing of the counter between quote and invoices, so that quotes will use the counter that invoices use.

* **Shared Invoice/Credit Counter** - The shared invoice credit counter switch enables sharing of the counter between credits and invoices, so that credits will use the counter that invoices use.  Enabling both Invoice/Quote, and Invoice/Credit shared counters, will have all three entities use the same counter as invoices do, and share number sequencing.

* **Reset Counter** - Generated counters can be reset at a variety of frequencies. It is important to note that in order to reset the counter, you must combine enough unique variables to ensure that the generated counter will still be unique.  For example - if you use an annual reset counter for new entities, it would be a perfect addition to include the year at the beginning of the invoice number.

### Clients, Invoices, Recurring Invoices, Payments, etc.

![alt text](/assets/images/settings/generated_numbers/generated_numbers_client.png "Client generated numbers")

The various entity records available that generated numbers apply to, are all listed with their own tabs at the top, for you to customize the behaviours of the number generation for each respective entity type.

* **Number Pattern** - Single line text field you can manually edit to finely tune your generated numbers.  Create a rule that outlines how new numbers will be generated.

```bash
{$date:y}-{$counter}
```
This example of a number pattern will produce a number like this, for the 9th count in 2021:  2021-0009

Care to ensure you are adding enough unique data to the number patterns if you are using the *Reset Counter* feature, to prevent counter collisions.

* **Number Counter** - The number counter is manually editable, but you can create counter collisions if you're not careful.  The number counter for any given entity type states the progress of the number counter for that entity.

Also, at the bottom you will see some useful information to help you customize your *Number Pattern* more effectively.  The large button **View Date Formats** links to a page with a PHP style guide.  Below that, every entity type has it's own list of variables that can be used to add further customization to the *Number Pattern*.

<h2 id=email_settings>Email Settings</h2>

These settings govern the behavior, appearance, and other settings for emails sent by Invoice Ninja software on behalf of your company.

* **Reply-To Name** - Specify a *reply-to name* to put at the top of your automated emails, such as to forward support requests to the appropriate contact.

* **Reply-To Email** - Specify the *reply-to email* of the user clients should contact for support.

* **BCC Email** - Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) email gets sent to a comma separated list of your specified email addresses.  BCC contact email addresses cannot be seen by any of the recipients of the email messages.

* **Email Design** - Select a design template for the appearance of your emails.

* **Email Signature** - Include a signature message along with all of your company email messages.  Multiple lines of text here for you to enter your custom signature.  HTML tags are respected here for formatting your email signature.

* **Send Time** - You can configure emails to be sent at a time of day localized to the clients timezone. For example, setting Send Time of 9 will send all scheduled documents at 9am localized to the clients timezone.

<x-warning>
**NOTE** If you are selecting Hour 24, 12:00am is technically the next day, in order to prevent emails from being dispatched technically a day later, this system will adjust the send time slightly so that it is scheduled to send just before midnight.
</x-warning>

* **Attach PDF** - Turning on this switch will send invoices as PDFs attached to your emails.  By default, your emails all have links to view the documents on the client portal, but it may be preferable to send the PDF directly.

* **Attach Documents** - When enabled, any files included in the *Documents* tab of the invoice, or other record, are attached to your emails to the clients.  Otherwise they can be viewed through the link on the client portal.

* **Attach UBL** - International standard Universal Business Language (UBL).   UBL documents are XML business documents such as purchase orders and invoices.  Enabling this feature attaches an XML document along with the PDF invoice.  Normally all the XML information is embedded in the PDF but some users prefer or cannot read the embedded XML data in a PDF. 

* **Enable E-invoice** - If you wish to produce e-invoices compatible with your region, you can enable this setting, and select the standard you wish to support.

<h2 id=client_portal>Client Portal</h2>

These settings govern the behavior, function, and presentation of the Client Portal.

There are four tabs in this setting panel, with unique features in each of them to cover.

### Settings

These settings control the basic or general function and behavior of the client portal.

* **Client Portal** - Enable or disable the client portal.  Disabling it will send all links to the client portal to a page that says the application has been blocked by the administrator.  Generally enabled by default.

* **Tasks** - Disabled by default.  Enable it to present a tab on the left hand side for clients, to view Tasks that are assigned to them, whether invoiced or not.  Clients can see the tasks in a list, with columns for the task description, project name, status, and total duration.  This can allow clients to see your company's progress on tasks for them so far, and give them an overview of your project work for them.

* **Client Registration** - Enabling this will allow new users to register themselves, and generate their own client entries in your database through a registration link on the client portal.  

* **Document Upload** - Enable allowing your clients to upload documents to the server, which will be attached as documents to their own client records.  In the client portal, they will see the option to drag and drop or click to upload files with a large button across the screen under the Documents tab.

* **Storefront** - Enables API access to create invoices automatically.  After enabling, it will generate a company key, or API key to be used by your own or another third party's apps to perform invoice creation, and act as an automated storefront for your company's products or services.

* **Terms of Service** - Custom, multi-line text field will be presented as your terms of service, in a discrete, clickable link at the bottom of every page of the client portal.

* **Privacy Policy** - Another custom, multi-line text field will be presented as your Privacy Policy, in a discrete, clickable link at the bottom of every page of the client portal, right next to the Terms of Service.

### Authorization

These settings govern authorization, accountability, and authentication features for the client portal and client's invoices.

* **Password Protect Invoices** -  Disabled by default.  When enabled, clients will be asked to set a password the first time they view their invoices.  From now on they will need to enter this password.

* **Invoice Terms Checkbox** - Prompts the client to accept the invoice terms when making a payment for an invoice in the client portal.

* **Quote Terms Checkbox** - Prompts the client to accept the quote terms when confirming the quote in the client portal.

* **Invoice Signature** - Require client to provide their signature on the screen with a mouse or touch screen, when paying an invoice on the client portal.

* **Quote Signature** - Require client to provide their signature on the screen with a mouse or touch screen, when confirming a quote on the client portal.

* **Show on PDF** - Show the client's signature on the invoice/quote PDF after it has been signed.

For a demo on how to configure capturing signatures or terms prior to a client paying an invoice (or approving a quote, watch this video)

<div class="video_container">
<x-video src="/assets/videos/advanced/signatures/signatures.mpd" is_dash="true" id="signatures-video"></x-video>
</div>

### Messages

These are messages to be presented to clients at various screens of the client portal.  

* **Dashboard** - From the dashboard page, the client will be greeted by this message.

* **Unpaid Invoice** - When viewing an unpaid invoice, the client will see this message.

* **Paid Invoice** - Client will see this message when viewing a paid invoice.

### Customize

Here we can customize the appearance of the client portal a little more.

* **Footer** - Multi-line text value to be presented with a solid bar on its own row at the bottom of every page in the client portal.

* **Custom CSS** - Enter your own custom CSS code to replace the stock CSS code of the client portal.

* **Custom JavaScript** - Enter any custom JavaScript code you would like to embed on the client portal also here.



<h2 id=templates_and_reminders>Templates & Reminders</h2>

Here we have one *edit* tab with some depth for control, and a *preview* tab, to see our changes.  This allows us to customize the messages that get included with your invoice, quote, payment, or reminder emails.

* **Template** - A drop down select menu to choose the email template we are going to modify.  Invoices, quotes, payments, reminders 1, 2, 3, etc.  **Reminders** are going to have more depth to customize, and their unique options will appear when you select a reminder template.  See below.

* **Subject** - Email subject line.  Default subject for an invoice email:  "New invoice $number from $company.name".  These values are sourced from your company data and records per message.  You can select different values from the menus below, according to your template category, to further customize the message in your email template subject lines.

* **Body** - Construct the body of the email template's message.  The default message body for an invoice email:  

     `"<p>To view your invoice for $amount, click the link below.</p><div class="center">$view_link</div>".`

     The email message body accepts basic HTML formatting for additional customization, and like with the subject, you may also add  other values to your body message, by selecting from the appropriate list of values below.

The categories below are tabs to select values to customize and personalize your message templates with, select the tabs to see the values ($amount, $due_date, etc) available for your template to get the relevant values in your messages.  Invoice and Quote template types have a slightly different set of available values, populating from the original invoice, or quote respectively.  

The values below are mostly self explanatory.  **Invoice / Quote** tab offers values populated from the relevant invoice or quote being emailed about.  **Client** tab offers values populated from the relevant client entry.  **Contact** tab offers values relevant for the first contact selected in the invoice record.  **Company** tab offers values from your own company record, to present information about your own company.  **User** tab offers values that represent the logged in user representing your company, who is sending the email message.  You can see what the values look like in an example message under the *Preview* tab.

### Reminder Templates

As mentioned above, when you select a reminder from the template list at the top of the edit tab, you will see new options appear specific to the reminders.

* **First, Second, and Third Reminders**
  * **Days** - A simple integer is accepted here for the number of days before sending the reminder email.

<h2 id=group_settings>Group Settings</h2>

Group settings is another category with a lot of depth, but most of the topics are covered exactly already because Group settings is mostly about enabling specific basic or advanced settings on a per-group basis, allowing you to build unique experiences for certain collections of clients.

The first step is to create a group, which is very simple, and only requires a group name.  Create  a group with the "+" icon in the top left corner of the group settings panel.  Give it a name and click "Save".

Select your group.  You will see an *Overview* tab and a *Documents* tab.   From the *Documents* tab you can upload files like most other Documents tabs, they will not be seen anywhere other than the admin portal.  The *Overview* tab has two options, an interactive Clients button, where you can view a list of clients in the group, or add clients to the group, and a *Configure Settings* button.

Note:  To remove a client from a group, it is easiest to edit the client directly and change their group or remove it.

### Configure Settings

Customize any options here to override the regular settings for each respective category, or leave a field blank to use the regular settings.

<h2 id=payment_links>Payment links</h2>

There are three views to the Payment links panel.  The payment link list, viewing a payment link, and creating or editing a payment link.

From the payment link list you can select existing payment links to view, or edit them.  You can also add new payment links with the "+" character in the top left corner of the payment links list panel.

When viewing a payment link you will see the initial cost of the payment link service at the top.  Below it, is a link you can copy and share to clients, or post on your storefront, which prompts clients to pay for, and setup the selected payment link, which creates the invoice and payment records for you when they do that.   Finally you will see links to filtered lists of invoices, or recurring invoices that are directly related to your payment link.   

When you *edit a payment link* there are three tabs with unique features to control the payment links with.

### Overview

* **Name** - The name of your monthly payment link, presentable to clients.

* **Group** - Assign payment links to groups, to allow group members to switch between payment links available exclusively to them based on their group membership.  Payment links not assigned to a group, will be visible to users who are not in a group only.  Use this to make special payment link models available to certain VIP clients, or etc.

* **Products** - A searchable, and selectable drop down list of available products from the company.  These products are issued as a one-time purchase on the payment link model.  For example, a setup service fee.

* **Recurring Products** - Also a searchable, and selectable drop down list of available products.  These products will appear on recurring invoices, for example, as the regular payment link fee.

### Settings
