# Payment Links

## Introduction

Payment Links (previously known as Subscriptions) are a supercharged version of our Buy Now links from version 4.

In version 5, payment links allow you to build an instant shop front where you can bundle your existing products into direct link purchases.

When you create a payment link, a direct link is generated which is available to use to directly purchase the given product(s). This could be suitable for digital sales that are one time, or recurring, or even both at once.

When you create the payment link you are able to combine one time and recurring products into a single payment link. For example, lets say you run a hosting business and want to create a payment link which has a single Setup charge as well as a monthly recurring charge for the server.

When your client purchases this, the Setup charge will only be applied to the first invoice, and then a recurring invoice is generated for any recurring products in the payment link.

If you want to allow your clients to move between subscriptions then this is possible by creating a Group and adding each payment link to the group. This bundles all of the payment links tagged with the same group together!

The settings pane allows you to define the frequency / auto billing and also promo codes/discounts. We also have integrated the ability for end user self service to change between subscriptions or even cancel these subscriptions. We also handle the accounting for you for refunds if they are defined.

## Webhook configuration

The final piece of the payment links puzzle is integrating with third party services. When a subscription is purchased / cancelled / upgraded we can notify a third party endpoint!

If you need to control events that occur outside of Invoice Ninja, you can configure the webhook endpoints to receive information as the user is stepping through the checkout process. All endpoints must be supported if you activate this feature of the application as the app will fail to proceed without a successful response from each of the following:

<x-warning>
	Webhooks are single time events that do not retry if your endpoint is unavailable.
</x-warning>

### Eligibility checker

This request queries the endpoint whether the client/contact is eligible to continue through the checkout. You may use this if you wish to restrict users to one subscription at a time, the payload that is sent to the endpoint looks like this

```
{
	"context" : "is_eligible",
	"subscription" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"contact" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"contact_email" : "customer@example.com",
	"client" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"account_key" : "unique_identifier",
}
```

A failed request would return the an array like this:

### Recurring Purchase

### Single Purchase

Where your payment link is only for a standard product, and _not_ a recurring product, then your endpoint will receive a single purchase webhook with the following configuration:

```
{
	"context" : "single_purchase",
	"invoice" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"client"  : "l4zbq7repr",

### Change Plan

If you support allowing clients to upgrade/downgrade their subscriptions, a change_plan webhook is fired.

When a client changes plans, there may be either a credit due, or a payment depending on the plan and pro rata refund that is generated. In these two cases, the payload differs with either a `credit` or `invoice` key appearing in the payload. The following are examples:

```
{
	"context" : "change_plan",
	"recurring_invoice" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"credit" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"client" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"subscription" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"contact" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"account_key" : "unique_identifier",
}
```

```
{
	"context" : "change_plan",
	"recurring_invoice" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"invoice" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"client" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"subscription" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"contact" : "l4zbq7repr",
	"account_key" : "unique_identifier",
}
```

}
```

### Subscription Cancellation

```
{
	"context" : "cancellation",
