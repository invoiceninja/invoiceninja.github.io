# Payment Gateways

Invoice Ninja integratesâ€‹ with many "payment gateways" (AKA, merchant processors). A payment gateway allows merchants (that's you!) to accept credit cards and other electronic payments online directly from invoices you email out to your clients.

See our [Payment Gateway Integrations](https://invoiceninja.com/payments/)

- Invoice Ninja includes deep integration with a range of high quality payment gateways, allowing you to get paid fast and across many different gateways.
- Payment gateways can be setup in _Settings>Payment Settings>New Gateway_. From there, you will choose your payment gateway and click Setup.
  - When you create or edit a payment gateway there are three tabs of settings to configure. **Credentials**, **Settings**, and **Limits/Fees**.
- You cannot accept online invoice payments without first setting up a payment gateway.
- The easiest way to start accepting online payments is via Stripe. Stripe is the largest online payment gateway provider with the most currencies.
  - Simply select "New Gateway," Stripe Setup, then you will be taken to the Stripe login screen to link your account. If you do not have a Stripe account already, Stripe will guide you to create an account right away.

You can easily setup payment gateways within your account under _Settings>Payment Settings>"New Gateway"_

![Add Payment Gateway dropdown list](/assets/images/gateways/AddPaymentGatewayDropdownList.png "Add Payment Gateway dropdown list")

- You can also integrate multiple gateways for different payment types. For example, you can configure Stripe for your ACH payments, Auth.net for you credit card payments and also PayPal. Gateways can also be configured based on a minimum or maximum amount, giving you maximum flexibility.
- Gateway fees can also be configured and passed on to the client when they perform transactions. For Stripe, Invoice Ninja can even auto calculate the fee amount to pass on to the customer if you enable this option.

### Credentials

In this first most important pane, you define the necessary values in order to facilitate communication between Invoice Ninja and your payment gateway's API.

### Settings

These settings govern some of the behaviors within Invoice Ninja's client portal, or admin portal, when looking at and interacting with your configured payment gateways. Some of these options may or may not appear depending on your payment gateway type.

- **Label** - This label is for internal reference purposes only, and applies to the payment gateway list on the admin portal.
- **Capture Card** - Setting to save client credit card details for next time or not. Enabled, or disabled. Otherwise set to "Enabled by Default" or "Disabled by Default" to give the client an option at checkout to "Save payment method details" for later.
- **Available Payment Types** - You will see a different list of supported payment methods, depending on the payment gateway service provider you chose. Eg. Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Alipay, Apple Pay, PayPal, etc. Enable or disable these options to give clients access to those payment methods at checkout.
- **Required Fields** - Tick the box for any field you wish to request the client to fill out for the payment records. Optionally, update the client record in Invoice Ninja with the client's additional information you requested.
- **Accepted Card Logos** - Determines which logos are displayed during checkout. Enable your accepted card logos to advertise support to your clients.

### Limits/Fees

Here we manage any payment limits, or fees we wish to apply to any transactions. Fees and limits applied are specific to the payment type you have selected.

- **Payment Type** - Only the payment methods that are enabled in your payment gateway _Settings_ pane are available to select from here. Choose one, and any fees or limits you set will be associated specifically with that payment method only.
- **Min Limit & Max Limit** - Enter a dollar value for the desired minimum, or maximum payment limits, and check the "Enable Min" or "Enable Max" boxes to enforce the minimum and maximum values.
- **Fee Percent** - Set a fee on transactions with this payment method, based on a % of the amount paid.
- **Fee Amount** - Set a flat rate fee for any transactions with this payment method. Can be charged in addition to the Fee Percent, if both values are set.
- **Fee Cap** - Set a maximum value for payment method fees charged to a client.
- **Tax** - When one, two, or three _Item Tax Rates_ are enabled (Basic Settings > Tax Settings) you will see one _Tax_ field here for each tax rate. These taxes are applied to the payment gateway fees you charge the customer.
- **Adjust Fee Percent** - Use the toggle switch to enable this feature. Use this when you intent to forward along the payment gateway fees to the customer. For example, if the payment processing fee for your Stripe account is 30 cents flat, and 1%, and you wanted to pass that to the customer, you would enter a 0.30 flat _Fee Amount_, and 1 for _Fee Percent_, and enable the _Adjust Fee Percent_. Because the total with fees will be higher, the _actual_ fees Stripe charges will be higher also. With this feature, Invoice Ninja will calculate and adjust the fee to charge the customer the expected fee amount, after the final invoice price is changed.
  - **_Note_** - When attempting to perfectly capture the payment gateway fee 100% and apply it to the client's payment using _Adjust Fee Percent_, you must disable _Invoice Tax Rates_ and exclusively use _Item Tax Rates_ (Basic Settings > Tax Settings). When a payment fee is applied to a customer invoice, it is entered as a line item, and any invoice tax rates will be applied to the fee, which will throw off the formula to calculate the new fee percent correctly.
  - You are responsible for verifying that your tax and fee settings comply with any laws that apply. Seek legal counsel if you require direction on fee and tax policies for your organization.

## Digital Wallets

The below are NOT payment gateways, but rather some information on how your clients can pay an invoice via the client portal using these digital wallets. Support for this depends on your payment gateway (ex. some gateways don't support Apple Pay or Google Pay, etc.)

### Apple Pay & Google Pay

As of this moment, to pay with Apple or Google Pay a credit card needs to already be configured in your browser. This is not Invoice Ninja preference, but a platform choice.

**Safari on desktop**:

- Safari on Mac running macOS Sierra or later
- A iPhone (iPad isn't supported yet) with a credit card configured in Wallet. More info can be found on [Apple's support site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681).

**Safari on mobile**:

- iOS 10.1 or later
- A card configured in the Wallet app

**Google Chrome**:

- [A saved credit card](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)

**Microsoft Edge**:

- Microsoft Edge 16.16299 or newer
- [A saved credit card](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026594/microsoft-account-add-update-remove-credit-cards-and-other-ways-to-pay)

<hr>

## Crypto

### BTCPay

The integration of BTCPay Server with Invoice Ninja enables you to accept bitcoin as a payment method, without fees, intermediaries with payments going directly to your bitcoin wallet.

## CBA PowerBoard

To integrate with the Commonwealth Banks PowerBoard gateway you can use the following steps:

<img class="" src="/assets/images/gateways/powerboard1.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

Then navigate to the My Company link and click on API & Settings

<img class="" src="/assets/images/gateways/powerboard2.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

You'll want to copy the API Secret Key and API Public Key values and then click on the Services sidebar menu option to find your Credit Card Gateway ID.

<img class="" src="/assets/images/gateways/powerboard3.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

You'll want to copy the ID value highlighted adjacent to your Credit Card Service Provider.

<img class="" src="/assets/images/gateways/powerboard4.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

### Invoice Ninja + PowerBoard

Back in Invoice Ninja, navigate to Settings > Payment Settings; create a new Payment Gateway and select CBA PowerBoard from the drop down.

<img class="" src="/assets/images/gateways/powerboard5.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

In The Credentials tab, you can copy in the Secret Key / Public key and the Gateway ID from the previous step.

Further down, you will see some toggles which can control the card types you would like to accept payments from, you can enable/disable these as needed.

### Advanced Settings
