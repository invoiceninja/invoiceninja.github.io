# E Invoicing

## Introduction
e-invoicing is rapidly being adopted in many jurisdictions. Invoice Ninja has supported UBL format invoices for some time and now we also support a range of e-invoice formats including direct delivery of e-invoices over the PEPPOL network.

All of the supported e-invoice standards can be downloaded directly after creating a standard invoice in Invoice Ninja. In some jurisdictions you are able to forward the e-invoice directly to your customer, however in some regions (ie, Italy) the invoice is sent through the government and then forwarded onto the customer. This introduces a number of complexities including both parties being registered with the government body (SDI for Italy). If you are in one of these jurisdictions, you will need to start the process (if you have not already) in acquiring a government routing ID.

## e-invoice standards
The list of supported e-invoice formats include:

- [PEPPOL (Universal - Cross industry / border)](#peppol)
- [ZUGFeRD - XRechung (Germany)](#zugferd)
- [Facturae (Spain)](#facturae)
- [Verifactu (Spain)](#verifactu)
- [FatturaPA (Italy)](#fatturapa)
- [FACT1 (Romania)](#fact1)
- [EN16931 (Generic)](#en16931)

## PEPPOL 
***BETA RELEASE***

Invoice Ninja has now rolled out a PEPPOL access point which will be available for both self hosted and hosted users to route their e-invoices through the PEPPOL network. 
## How does it work?

## How do I get started?

### All users
Each particular jurisdiction has a specific set of fields which MUST be populated in order for an e-invoice to be validated. For example, in Germany a Payment Means field is required within the e-invoice. What is this? This is the sending parties paymnet details, ie IBAN + financial account meta data such as bank, FIB etc. Without this data the e-invoice cannot be generated or sent.  As you onboard through the application you will have the opportunity to validate your data to ensure delivery of your e-invoices.

### Hosted users
We will be sending out notifications to our hosted users for the steps required for onboarding in their particular region. 

### Self hosted users
Self Hosted users will be proxying their e-invoices through our hosted platform. What does this mean? In order to send your e-invoices you'll need to register your service with Invoice Ninja and we will create your legal entity id for you. Your system will then route e-invoices through our system as required. For security and data privacy, the service will only ever proxy the data that is sent, we will never store the data that is sent.

## How do I prepare my Invoice Ninja installation to support e-invoicing?
There are a few important considerations with e-invoicing.

1. All taxes must be applied at the line level. Total taxes are not supported with e-invoicing
2. If you do not charge VAT/TAX on your invoices, you still need to apply a tax code/reason ie. Cross Border exemption, seller with no VAT number etc
3. After an invoice has been "sent" it can never be modified, instead if there are changes that need to be applied you must create a new Invoice/Credit with the changes

## Can I receive e-invoices?
Yes, in an upcoming version we will also support the delivery of e-invoicing via the peppol network directly into your company.  

(Self hosted users will receive these via WebHook)

## Getting started checklist

### Hosted Users
 - Register with your government body if e-invoices are to be routed via government portal.
 - Enable e-invoicing (Settings > E Invoice - select e invoice type => PEPPOL)

## ZUGFeRD

<img class="" src="/assets/images/einvoices/zugferd.png" alt="CBA PowerBoard"/>

Enabling ZUGFeRD is as simple as enabling e-invoicing in Settings > E-Invoice, selecting the appropriate X format you wish to generate and save! As the ZUGFeRD is very comprehensive, you can also embed the einvoice within the PDF document itself, simply toggle on the Merge E-Invoice and PDF switch and then save.

** NOTE **

The ZUGFeRD standard does not accept negative valued invoices. Historically some users may have used a negative invoice to indicate a Credit Note, this is no longer possible. Instead a dedicated Credit Note should be generated with matching POSTIVE values which reflect the credit you wish to assign.

## Facturae

Spanish e-invoice documents are supported and generate valid documents. these can be uploaded into the FACe system.

## Verifactu (alpha)

Support for Verifactu is nearing. The invoicing flow within Invoice Ninja will remain unchanged however there are several important points to note:

1. Power of Attorney.

In order for Invoice Ninja to submit invoices to AEAT on your behalf, AEAT requires you to provide permission. This can be done directly from the AEAT website and searching for Invoice Ninja in the list of registered providers.

2. Document submission process.

- After an invoice has been submitted, it cannot be modified and the document itself will move into a "locked state"
- It is possible to cancel a submitted document by either using the Cancel or Delete option on the invoice.
- If you need to create a rectification invoice (Credit Note), you will need to use the Rectify menu option, this will generate a negative invoice linked to the existing invoice.
- Rectification invoices can be cancelled, this will remove the credit note linked to the invoice.

**NOTE**

Once an invoice has had a rectification invoice (credit note) applied to it, it cannot be delete unless all of the credit notes attached to it have also been cancelled/deleted.

3. Verifactu tab:

On the edit invoice page, after saving an invoice you will now see a Verifactu tab, inside here will be additional information about the invoice validation.

4. Mandatory information.

For invoices to Spanish users. You MUST have entered a NIF for the client this is a requirement from AEAT. The only exception would be if no NIF is available to use the clients Passport Number in the Client's ID Number field. AEAT requires the census data on the recipient. Sending will fail if you attempt to send an invoice to a client without these details.

## FatturaPA

Italian e-invoices can be generated, however as there is no connection in the SDI as yet. This format is not currently production ready.

## FACT1

Romanian e-invoices can be generated, however as there is no delivery connection as yet. This format is not currently production ready.

## EN16931

Standard EN16931 documents can be generated and downloaded as needed.
