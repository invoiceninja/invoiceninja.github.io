The number counter for any given entity type states the progress of the number counter for that entity.\n\nAlso, at the bottom you will see some useful information to help you customize your *Number Pattern* more effectively.

BCC contact email addresses cannot be seen by any of the recipients of the email messages.\n\n* **Email Design** - Select a design template for the appearance of your emails.\n\n* **Email Signature** - Include a signature message along with all of your company email messages.  Multiple lines of text here for you to enter your custom signature.  HTML tags are respected here for formatting your email signature.\n\n* **Send Time** - You can configure emails to be sent at a time of day localized to the clients timezone. For example, setting Send Time of 9 will send all scheduled documents at 9am localized to the clients timezone.\n\n:::warning\n**NOTE** If you are selecting Hour 24, 12:00am is technically the next day, in order to prevent emails from being dispatched technically a day later, this system will adjust the send time slightly so that it is scheduled to send just before midnight.\n:::\n\n* **Attach PDF** - Turning on this switch will send invoices as PDFs attached to your emails.  By default, your emails all have links to view the documents on the client portal, but it may be preferable to send the PDF directly.\n\n* **Attach Documents** - When enabled, any files included in the *Documents* tab of the invoice, or other record, are attached to your emails to the clients.  Otherwise they can be viewed through the link on the client portal.\n\n* **Attach UBL** - International standard Universal Business Language (UBL).   UBL documents are XML business documents such as purchase orders and invoices.  Enabling this feature attaches an XML document along with the PDF invoice.  Normally all the XML information is embedded in the PDF but some users prefer or cannot read the embedded XML data in a PDF. \n\n* **Enable E-invoice** - If you wish to produce e-invoices compatible with your region, you can enable this setting, and select the standard you wish to support.\n\n## Client Portal \\{#client_portal}\n\nThese settings govern the behavior, function, and presentation of the Client Portal.\n\nThere are four tabs in this setting panel, with unique features in each of them to cover.\n\n### Settings\n\nThese settings control the basic or general function and behavior of the client portal.\n\n* **Client Portal** - Enable or disable the client portal.  Disabling it will send all links to the client portal to a page that says the application has been blocked by the administrator.  Generally enabled by default.\n\n* **Tasks** - Disabled by default.  Enable it to present a tab on the left hand side for clients, to view Tasks that are assigned to them, whether invoiced or not.  Clients can see the tasks in a list, with columns for the task description, project name, status, and total duration.

This allows us to customize the messages that get included with your invoice, quote, payment, or reminder emails.\n\n* **Template** - A drop down select menu to choose the email template we are going to modify.  Invoices, quotes, payments, reminders 1, 2, 3, etc.  **Reminders** are going to have more depth to customize, and their unique options will appear when you select a reminder template.  See below.\n\n* **Subject** - Email subject line.  Default subject for an invoice email:  "New invoice $number from $company.name".  These values are sourced from your company data and records per message.

The default message body for an invoice email:  \n\n     `"<p>To view your invoice for $amount, click the link below.</p><div class="center">$view_link</div>".`\n\n     The email message body accepts basic HTML formatting for additional customization, and like with the subject, you may also add  other values to your body message, by selecting from the appropriate list of values below.\n\nThe categories below are tabs to select values to customize and personalize your message templates with, select the tabs to see the values ($amount, $due_date, etc) available for your template to get the relevant values in your messages.

Create  a group with the "+" icon in the top left corner of the group settings panel.  Give it a name and click "Save".\n\nSelect your group.  You will see an *Overview* tab and a *Documents* tab.   From the *Documents* tab you can upload files like most other Documents tabs, they will not be seen anywhere other than the admin portal.  The *Overview* tab has two options, an interactive Clients button, where you can view a list of clients in the group, or add clients to the group, and a *Configure Settings* button.\n\nNote:  To remove a client from a group, it is easiest to edit the client directly and change their group or remove it.\n\n### Configure Settings\n\nCustomize any options here to override the regular settings for each respective category, or leave a field blank to use the regular settings.\n\n* **Company Details** - Configure a custom company profile for the client group.

The payment link list, viewing a payment link, and creating or editing a payment link.\n\nFrom the payment link list you can select existing payment links to view, or edit them.  You can also add new payment links with the "+" character in the top left corner of the payment links list panel.\n\nWhen viewing a payment link you will see the initial cost of the payment link service at the top.  Below it, is a link you can copy and share to clients, or post on your storefront, which prompts clients to pay for, and setup the selected payment link, which creates the invoice and payment records for you when they do that.   Finally you will see links to filtered lists of invoices, or recurring invoices that are directly related to your payment link.   \n\nWhen you *edit a payment link* there are three tabs with unique features to control the payment links with.\n\n### Overview\n\n* **Name** - The name of your monthly payment link, presentable to clients.\n\n* **Group** - Assign payment links to groups, to allow group members to switch between payment links available exclusively to them based on their group membership.

Use this to make special payment link models available to certain VIP clients, or etc.\n\n* **Products** - A searchable, and selectable drop down list of available products from the company.  These products are issued as a one-time purchase on the payment link model.  For example, a setup service fee.\n\n* **Recurring Products** - Also a searchable, and selectable drop down list of available products.  These products will appear on recurring invoices, for example, as the regular payment link fee.\n\n### Settings\n\n* **Frequency** - A drop down selection list to choose a regular interval to charge the clients for this payment link model.\n\n* **Auto bill**\n  * *Enabled* - A user a payment will be automatically attempted if a payment method is stored on file.\n  * *Enabled by default* - The client will be given the option to allow payment methods to be stored with the radio box selected.\n  * *Disabled by default* - The client will be given the option to allow payment methods to be stored with the radio box unselected.\n  * *Disabled* - No option is given, and auto billing is disabled.\n\n* **Promo Code** - An optional promo code to reward the client if they enter the correct code at checkout.\n\n* **Promo Discount** - Select from the drop down menu on the right, either "Percent" or "Amount" to discount the client by a flat rate, or percentage of the invoice amount for that period.

The users list, viewing a user, and creating or editing a user, and their permissions in the admin portal..\n\nWhen viewing a user, you see their email address at the top, which is used to sign into the admin portal with.  Below, you can see a list of buttons for all the client, invoice, quote, task, etc, records that the user has created, or been assigned.  The buttons will open user-filtered lists of the records for each respective category.\n\nWhen at the edit user pane, you will see three tabs to customize user settings with:\n\n### Details\n\n* **First Name** - The user\'s first name.\n\n* **Last Name** - The user\'s last name.\n\n* **Email** - The user\'s email address.  Mandatory for the user to log in with.
